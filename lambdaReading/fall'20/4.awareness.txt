section 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.3.1

In-meeting comments:
* the definition of awareness in terms of knowledge was really beautiful:
  you either know sth or you know that you don't know it.
* i like to discuss awareness generated by primitive propositions more.
  b/c following their definitions and properties it makes sense, however,
  the question that if an agent is aware of sth they may still don't know
  how to link their thoughts also makes lots of sense intuitively. Did 
  they answer this question anywhere?
* could we discuss partitional awareness structure more?
  how are the subsets disjoint? based on what property? like even odd
* presentation order effects with awareness correspondence was rather 
  interesting
* i like to discuss properties of axiom systems.

In-meeting comments:
* T is a special formula b/c you need to have a set of primitive formulas
  and then having it as p or not p changes that set.
* partition and equivalence are the same thing, so the group of things 
  that are equivalent are in one partition.
