Section 1.2 including Section 1.2.1(Language) from Ditmarsch’s chapter 
(i.e., pages 1 to 8 inclusive), and Section 1 to 5 inclusive from 
Holliday’s paper.


Summary:
* episteme: knowledge and information
* knowledge can be about knowledge and we can even model knowledge about
  other's knowledge --> VERY COOL
* Reasoning about knowing what others know (about your knowledge) is also 
  typical in strategic situations, where one needs to make a decision 
  based on how others will act (where the others, in turn, are basing 
  their decision on their reasoning about you). This kind of scenario is 
  the focus of game theory.
* epistemic logic reasons about knowledge: K_a
* doxastic logic reasons about belief: B_a
* K and B are modal operators

Comments/questions:
* only spent an hour and didn't finish the entire thing but it was very 
  fun and half way through I was thinking of its application in politics!
* knowledge can be about knowledge and we can even model knowledge about
  other's knowledge --> VERY COOL
* could we discuss the four formulas in page 2 and 3? also they're plain
  En explanation of formulas was really helpful
* the K_a K_b \neg K_a K_b m --> just amazing!
* also the authors seem to not know about email add ons that let you know
  if your sent emails have been read or not!
* i feel like politiciouns should use episteme logic to just lie better or
  maybe I've been emerging myself way too much in news instead of working!
* very concise and beautiful modal lang definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* she knows whether or not q as k q \vee K \neg q, why not K (q \vee \neg q)?
  never mind, I got it! 
* could we discuss how Lewis describes ways the world might be?
* I feel like i need to read this multiple times to maybe grasp it but man
  is it fun!
* also could we discuss the Moore's paradox given on the spy ex?

In-meeting comments:

Martin:
* this is about knowledge and not understanding. you could know sth but
  don't understand. (isn't that deep!)
