Summary:
* I'm not in the mood to write a summary this term!

Comments:
* no wonder so many misunderstanding happens in natural language.
* some examples would help understanding different modal logics easier and 
  maybe more intuitive.
* the discussion about the geniune difference between ought to ought to 
  and ought to was interesting.
* the discussion of possible worlds and that when one says that sth is 
  necessary it doesnâ€™t mean in all possible worlds rather a class of 
  possible worlds made some of the previous sections more clear.
* why would M be incorrect if we read the square as it is ought to be or 
  it is the case that?


In-meeting comments:

Martin:
* PL uses different logics such as in type systems or operational semantics.
* This could be used to determine the validity of an expression in a given 
  time by using temporal logic.
